# TCPServer

This is a learning project I made in order to learn more about server-client relationships.
The plan is to make this applicable somewhere.

## Build

```
make
```

## Usage

```
./server
./client
```

## TODO
- [x] makefile
- [ ] handle multiple connections
- [ ] test if it works in local network
