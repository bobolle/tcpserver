# TCPServer

This is a learning project I made in order to learn more about server-client relationships.
The plan is to make this applicable somewhere.

## Build

```
make
```

## Usage

```
# open in different sessions
./server
./client

client:
type any text from client to send to the server
type exit to quit

server:
revices and views messages automatically
```

## TODO
- [x] makefile
- [ ] handle multiple connections
- [ ] test if it works in local network
