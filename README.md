# TCPServer

This is a learning project I made in order to learn more about server-client relationships.
The plan is to make this applicable somewhere.

## Build

```
g++ -o server server.cpp TCPServer.cpp
g++ -o client client.cpp TCPClient.cpp
```

## Usage

```
./server
./client
```

## TODO
- [ ] handle multiple connections
- [ ] test if it works in local network
